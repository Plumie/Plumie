### Hi there 🫡

I'm a french web developer, working as a freelancer under the name [chromatique.studio](https://chromatique.plume.moe/), but currently seeking for a new full-time role.

My past experiences fuel my drive to build robust, useful tools where a focus on high polish never comes at the expense of speed and accessibility.

I specialize in the modern JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem (React, Next.js, Node.js), but I also have both personal and professional experience with PHP, C#, and Python.

📫 Feel free to contact me at hello@plume.moe
